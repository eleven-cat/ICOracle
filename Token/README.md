# ICOracle Economic Model

## Token Economic Model

![Economic Model](img/ICOracle-model.png)

ICOracle Node mine token.
- Applicants are required to stake OTs to the DAO, and the first 21 applicants with the largest staked (and no less than 20,000,000 OTs) qualify as nodes.
- Community users can stake OTs to their trusted node applicants.
- The node's work is mainly to provide data and off-chian calculations to ICOracle Canister, and monitor Events Canister.
- The DAO Canister will share the mining reward pool equally for each period based on the valid workload.

Dapp calls ICOracle data or subscribes to events by paying OTs.
- Canister internal calls to ICOracle Canister require payment of OTs.
- Off-chain applications calling ICOracle Canister with an anonymous account is for free.
- Dapps pay OTs and subscribe to events for ICOracle data to be notified when events occur.

DAO Canister is used to manage proposals and govern the distribution and destruction of tokens.
- Fees received by the ICOracle Canister are destroyed by the DAO Canister.
- An account needs to stake 500,000 OTs to submit a proposal. If the proposal is not approved, 50% of the staked token will be deducted and destroyed.
- Nodes participate in voting with 100 votes per node; if users want to vote directly themselves, they need to stake at least 2,000,000 OTs to participate in voting with 1 vote per account.

Note: Economic model rules may be modified during the project upgrade process prior to the release of the official version.
